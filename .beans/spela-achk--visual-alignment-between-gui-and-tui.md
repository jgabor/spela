Bring the GUI closer to the TUI's visual language and layout structure. The GUI and TUI share the same color palette but differ in layout (sidebar+content vs single column), header (logo+metrics vs simple nav), section styling (bordered boxes vs headers only), and information display (tables vs lists).

## Checklist

- [x] square off panels, buttons, and list items to match TUI geometry
- [x] shift list styling to divider-based rows with monospace emphasis
- [x] align detail panel typography to monospace for labels and controls
- [x] align header/footer typography to the TUI status aesthetic
